# What are computational best-practices?

We want to support and promote reproducible and open-source computational methods for
the environmental health sciences. Best-practices include:

- Open Source
- Version Control
- Continuous Integration 
- Unit and Integration Testing
- Reproducible Pipelines

## Focus Areas

We are developing a governance plan which will include focus areas, but we envision
something along the lines of (1) Geospatial Methods (2) Health Analyses (3) Geophysics 
and (4) Computer Science

# Get Involed

We are in the process of developing a strategy for forming the community of practice
around best-practices for computational methods and applications in the environmental 
health sciences. We encourage anyone interested in this topic to provide their contact
information below, so you can be involved.
